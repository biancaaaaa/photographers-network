REDUX THUNK INFOS :

- Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. 
  The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. 
  The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.




A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.

  // calculation of 1 + 2 is immediate
  // x === 3
  let x = 1 + 2;

  // calculation of 1 + 2 is delayed
  // foo can be called later to perform the calculation
  // foo is a thunk!
  let foo = () => 1 + 2;
  The term originated as a humorous past-tense version of "think".





  store state = {
   user : {
    displayName : '',
    email : '',
    photoURL : '',
    type : '',   
   },
   userNotifications : {
    qweasd : {
     id : qweasd, 
    }....
   },
   allJobs : {
    fetchedOnce : false,
    data : {
     dqwea : {
      id: dqwea,
      ...
     }
    }
   },
   visitedProfiles : {
    wqeasd : {
     id : wqeasd,
     ...
    }
   },
   appliedJobs : {
    asdq : {
     id : asdq,
     ...
    }
   },
   postedJobs : {
    orq : {
     id : orq , 
     ...
    }
   },
   visitedJobs : {
    dqwz : {
     id: dqwz,
    }
    ....
   },
   appLoading : true,
  }
