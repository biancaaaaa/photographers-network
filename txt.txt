REDUX THUNK INFOS :

- Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. 
  The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. 
  The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.




A thunk is a function that wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.

  // calculation of 1 + 2 is immediate
  // x === 3
  let x = 1 + 2;

  // calculation of 1 + 2 is delayed
  // foo can be called later to perform the calculation
  // foo is a thunk!
  let foo = () => 1 + 2;
  The term originated as a humorous past-tense version of "think".






  TODO : 
 -> In dashboard not sure about the loading prop that i'm passing down
 -> In profileEdit must do the logic
 -> In profile must do the whole logic, a lot..
 -> take a look at openSingleJob might not work, also i do not think we are checking if there is a user on, just company/photographer 
 -> PrivateJobReq must take care of functionality, also check to see if the person is a company or photographer, i do not think i'm doing that
 -> Clean GbNav
 -> Signin error handlings!
 -> Hirable button
 -> Profile page still ugly code
 
 -> CREATING NEW PUBLIC JOB ADD IT TO THE OPEN JOBS
 -> Finish the private job thingy


 TO REDO : 
  -> SIGNUP, send the data to the profile reducer or the user and set it directly stop the onauth from firing when the suer signs up
  -> DO SOMETHING ON ERROR
  -> The profile page 
  -> CreateJob check the data from the from
  -> The search-photographer is not needed with the new DB structure / totally rebuild








Did/Changed : 

Sign-up {

}
