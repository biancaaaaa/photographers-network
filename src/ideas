// IDEAS 
-> IF A PHOTOGRAPHER REJECTED JOB OFFER , DO NOT LET THE COMPANY SEND IT AGAIN

Database structure : 
 -> We have worked on it, had a initial plan for it, then we have added new things day by day, now things are not linking anymore as they should,
 i think that we are building up on an unstable base.








 -> Jobs : 
  -> public
   --> sent-to-private
  -> private

Public : Everyone can see it , also the company can sent it as private request
 -> sent-to-private : Company already sent it to a photographer

Private : Visible just for a specific photographer

Company Jobs field : 
 Open jobs both private and public saved in the postedJobs
 Once a job is done , take it out from postedJobs also from the request push it into some inProgress thing.








Public job : {
 private : false,
 sentTo : 'xadaz123zsad',
}

Private job : {
 private : true,
 sentTo : 'asdz123zsda5125',
}
